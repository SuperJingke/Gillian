# Jingke Liang
## ---Programmer
My name is Jingke. I was studied in the University of Toronto for Applied Statistics program. I took some
computer science courses to learn how to code with Python.And I indeed have experience in projects using Python, R, SAS, and HTML. As for web development experience, I’ve volunteered in the church helping with website maintenance. I want to have my own fashion e-commerce brand <a href="https://jingkeliang003.wixsite.com/gill-smiley-2019">GillSmiley</a> in the future. Hence, I chose to study here.

## My brief overview looking to get out from this course
As my wish, I am so excited to start my journey here as long as I am getting closer to my dream. I’ve found this course has given an overview of web tools, which I haven’t heard of them before. I feel that there are so many stuffs to learn for I am just like a blank piece of paper. As a quick learner, I’ll do my best in this semester.

## Topic or subject to explore
I am willing to learning anything I don’t know. But if you’re asking for more specific topic that I want to explore I would say that I am interested in most commonly used tools in a successful business model (e-commerce) and future trends.
